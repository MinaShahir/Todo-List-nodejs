Todos-nodejs

Description:

The Todo List application is a web-based application that allows users to create, manage, and track daily tasks.
The user interface provides an intuitive dashboard where users can add new tasks, categorize them, mark them as completed, or delete them when no longer needed.

The application is built using Node.js to handle server-side logic and Express.js to manage routing and HTTP requests.
EJS is used as the templating engine to dynamically render views, while CSS and JavaScript are used to create a clean,
modern, and responsive user interface.

MongoDB is used as the database to store tasks persistently, and Mongoose is used as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) layer
to manage data schemas and database operations.
Nodemon is used during development to automatically restart the server when code changes are detected.

Application Flow:

- Users can view all pending and completed tasks from the dashboard.
- New tasks can be added using a modal form with category selection.
- Tasks can be marked as completed or deleted.
- Tasks are stored securely in MongoDB and retrieved dynamically.

Overall, this Todo List application demonstrates a complete full-stack implementation using Node.js technologies,
focusing on usability, clean UI, and persistent data storage.
